# Equivalence Relation
Program that determins if a set of ordered pairs is an equivalence relation

# Terms to know
* Reflexivity: for each element e in the universal set, the ordered pair (e, e) is in the relation
* Symmetry: for each ordered pair (a, b) in the relation, the ordered pair (b, a) is also in the relation
* Transitivity: for any a, b, and c in the universal set, if (a, b) and (b, c) are in the relation, then (a, c) is also in the relation
* Equivalence Relation: Any set of ordered pairs that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive

# Functions
* showSOP - prints ordered pair elements of set
* showUniv - prints unsigned elements of universe set
* er - returns whether set of orderd pair is an equivalence relation. Test for Reflexivity, Symmetry, Transitivity
