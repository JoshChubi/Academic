# Arithmetic and Geometric Series
Program that when given 3 variables for Arithmetic and Geometric series, will solve for missing two variables<br />
Become familiarized with function pointers in C++

## Ignore These Cases
### Arithmetic<br />
* F(irst), I(nc), T(otal)
* L(ast), I(nc),  T(otal)
### Geometric<br />
* F(irst), N(umber of terms), T(otal)
* L(ast),  N(umber of terms),  T(otal)

## Tutorial
Enter Three of the five variables of a series<br />
In format, seperated by space: var value var value var value<br />
* F(irst) term
* L(ast) term
* I/R (increment/ratio)
* N(number) of terms
* T(otal)
