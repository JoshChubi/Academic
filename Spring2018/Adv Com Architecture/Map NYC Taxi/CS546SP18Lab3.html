<H1>Spring 2018 CS546 Lab Assignment 3</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P><P>
This is the third lab assignment for this course.  It is due no later than Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 
the start of the lecture period.  
You will submit it through a Canvas upload.</P>

<P>Before starting this assignment, you should review the 
<A HREF="http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/murphyh/CS546/CS546Week5ExerciseA.html">bit map exercise part A</A>
and <A HREF="http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/murphyh/CS546/CS546Week5ExerciseB.html">bit map exercise part B</A>.


<P>The naming convention specified for this assignment is to use your initials (three letters please), the word 
Lab, and the digit 3 for this assignment. 
Use 'X' if you do not have a middle name or last name. 
Thus, if W.C.Fields were taking this class and turning in this lab, he would provide a file named WCFLab3.cpp. 
If Madonna were taking this class, her lab would be MxxLab3.cpp.</P>
<P>Only turn in the program source file, 
i.e. the C++ source code with embedded Intel assembler code. </P>

<P>Your program should start with the following heading: 
<CODE><PRE><B><FONT COLOR="green">
// Lastname, Firstname        CS546 Section 14860  Date completed
// Third Laboratory Assignment - Map NYC Taxi Destinations
</B></PRE></CODE></FONT>
</P>
<H3>The Problem</H3>
<P>The city of New York provides a monthly detailed listing of taxi rides within the five boroughs.
Your assignment is to read in an extract of the destinations, which are provided in latitude and
longitude.  Each destination should be plotted as a point on a gray scale bit map.</P>
<P>Set each pixel to all one bits (255) if it is visited, and set it to zero (black) if it is not a destination in the file.</P>

<P>Write a program based on the Week 5 Lab Exercise program B to read in the file of destinations and plot them on a
bit map.  The dimensions should be 1024 by 1024 pixels.  The background color should be black.  The center point of 
the plot area should be latitude 40.765482, longitude -73.980006.  (This the corner of 7th Avenue and West 57th Street, 
i.e. Carnegie Hall.)   The southern boundary should be roughly 40.700455 and the northern boundary should be roughly 
40.830509.  The eastern and western boundaries will be proportionate to these.</P>

<P>The processing steps are basically:
<OL>
<LI>Create a character array, 1024 by 1024 entries.
<LI>Open the input file.  
<LI>Read in data.  You will have to decide how much.  Each longitude and latitude point will comprise
two float values.
<LI>Validate that the longitude and latitude are within the bounds of the bit map.
<LI>Convert the longitude and latitude to a position within the bit map.
<LI>Examine the current value at that position.  If it is less than 255, set it to 255. 
<LI>At the end of the input, write out the bit map headers, color map, and the bit map array itself.
<LI>Start Windows Paint to display your output.
<LI>End the program.
</OL>

<H3>Notes</H3>
<P>Your input will be a <A HREF="http://faculty.piercecollege.edu/murphyh/CS546/L2Data10K.zip"> binary file.</A></P>
<P>You can read in more than two floats at a time from the input file.</P>
<P>The bit map will use a Mercator projection, so no adjustment of the longitude value will be needed.</P>
<P>To convert latitude to a bit position, subtract the bottom boundary from it, then divide by the latitude range of 
the bit map (top minus bottom), then multiply it by the vertical dimension of the bit map in pixels.  So, for:<BR>
40.748418   (latitude of the Empire State Building)<BR>
a. subtract the bottom boundary: 40.748418 - 40.700455 = 0.047963<BR>
b. divide by the latitude range of the bit map: 0.047963 / (40.830509 - 40.700455) = 0.047963 / 0.130054 = 0.3687929...<BR>
c. multiply that quotient by the vertical dimension in pixels: 0.3687929 * 1024 = 377.64 = 378.<BR>
Follow a similar process for the longitude.  Remember that west longitudes are expressed as negative numbers, with the
absolute value of the number growing larger the further west the point, up to a maximum of 180.</P>
<H3>Sample Output</H3>
<P>The following image was created in a sample solution to the lab assignment.  It uses the same binary file mentioned above.  The file has 10,000 pairs of latitude and longitude sets.  Of these, 784 were outide the drawing boundaries.</P>
<P>This sample is not representative of what your output should look like.  In particular, if each pixel is incremented by one, the result will look like a black image, since only a handful of the points had more than 3 entries.  To make the points more obvious, the example sets the pixel to 255 no matter how many stops were represented.  This is not a heat map, which will have varying intensities.</P>

<H3>Grading Standards</H3>
<P><UL>
<LI>Successful display of input file as a bit map: 7 points
<LI>Successful compile by the instructor: 2 points
<LI>Correct naming standards followed: 1 point
</UL>
