<H1>Spring 2018 CS546 Lab Assignment 5 Option A</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P><P>
This is the fifth lab assignment for this course.  It is due no later than Tuesday, May 29, 2018 by 11:59 PM.
You will submit it through a Canvas upload.</P>

<P>This assignment will use some of the bit map creation skills you used in lab assignment 3.</P>  

<P>There will be another option for lab assignment 5.</P>  

<P>The naming convention specified for this assignment is to use your initials (three letters please), the word 
Lab, and the digit 5 for this assignment. 
Use 'X' if you do not have a middle name or last name. 
Thus, if W.C.Fields were taking this class and turning in this lab, he would provide a file named WCFLab5.cpp. 
If Madonna were taking this class, her lab would be MxxLab5.cpp.</P>
<P>Only turn in the program source file, 
i.e. the C++ source code with embedded Intel assembler code.  You should use Intel assembly code to generate each 
digit's bit map.</P>

<P>Your program should start with the following heading: 
<CODE><PRE><B><FONT COLOR="green">
// Lastname, Firstname        CS546 Section 14860  Date completed
// Fifth Laboratory Assignment - Option A - Generate USPS bar codes
</B></PRE></CODE></FONT>
</P>
<H3>The Problem</H3>
<P>The United States Postal Service offers reduced rates for bulk mailers who follow their addressing requirements.
One of these is to generate a machine-readable bar code on each envelope below the address.</P>
<P>The <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSTNET">Wikipedia article about PostNet</A> explains the bar code.  
It includes a check digit, which you will also need to generate.  We will not be generating the two Delivery Point digits.</P>

<P>Write a program to prompt the user for a nine-digit Zip+4 code.  You should allow the user to enter a five-digit zip code,
followed by the four-digit +4 portion.  Your program should then generate a bit map with the appropriate PostNet-coded symbols, including the check digit.
 The background color should be white.</P>
 <P>The size of the bit map depends upon the resolution of the printer used to put it on paper.  The 
 <A HREF=" https://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/204.htm">USPS site</A> presents the following standards for bar size:<BR>
<CODE><PRE>
1.2.5 POSTNET Barcode Dimensions and Spacing
POSTNET barcodes are subject to these standards for bar dimensions and spacing. Extraneous ink or ink voids must not 
cause any bar to fail to meet these standards:

A full bar must be 0.125 ±0.010 inch high.
A half bar must be 0.050 ±0.010 inch high.
All bars must be 0.020 ±0.005 inch wide.
Measured over any 1/2 inch, horizontal spacing of the bars must be 22 ±2 bars per inch, and pitch (a bar and a space) must 
average at least 0.0416 inch but no more than 0.05 inch. The clear vertical space between bars must not be less than 0.012 
inch or more than 0.04 inch.
</PRE></CODE></P>
<P>The printer in the room 1505 lab is an HP Lawerjet 4015p, which prints at a resolution of 1200 dots per inch.  Thus,
using the USPS standards above, our full height bars should be 1200 pixels times 0.125, or 150 pixels high, and the half bars
should be 1200 times 0.05, or 60 pixels high.  Bars should be 1200 times 0.02, or 24 pixels wide.</P>
<P>Bars should be spaced on roughly 54-pixel centers, so there should be 30 white pixels between each 24-pixel-wide bar.
</P>
<P>As a result, the bar code bit map should be about 2900 pixels wide, and at least 160 pixels high - you should leave some white space at the top, bottom, and edges.</P>
<P>The bit map will be monochrome, but may be produced as a gray scale image like we did in lab 3. </P>
<P>Your output file should be named FMLLab5.bmp (i.e. the same naming convention as your program name), and must be placed in the C:\Temp directory.

<P>There are several bar code generators on the internet, and you should use them to check your output.</P>
<H3>Sample </H3>
<CODE><PRE><B>
Enter a five-digit Zip code and a four-digit Zip+4 extension:
91371 0001
Bit map file FMLLab5.bmp created.
</B></PRE></CODE>
<HR>
<H3>Grading Standards</H3>
<P><UL>
<LI>Successful display of input values as a bit map: 7 points
<LI>Successful compile by the instructor: 2 points
<LI>Correct naming standards followed: 1 point
</UL>
